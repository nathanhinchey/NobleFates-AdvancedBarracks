# Advanced Barracks
## A Noble Fates Mod
This mod adds Barracks buildings and Gynmnasium rooms.

## What's in it!

### The Barracks
A barracks is a place for your soldiers to live, train, and keep their weapons
handy. It requires a Dining Room, a Storeroom, a Gymnasium, and a Bunk Room. It
gets its tier from its component rooms, like most tiered buildings.

### Gymnasiums
A Gymnasium is a room with training dummies in it for guards and rangers to
practice their skills. The size requirements are standard for tiered rooms. One
dummy per tier. (Base prestige: 5 per Tier)
